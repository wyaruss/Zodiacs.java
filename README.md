# Zodiacs.java
This is a simple Java program that prompts the user for their birthday as an input and returns their zodiac sign as an output (no, I don't believe in astrology). 

TO-DO:

-make more efficient/less verbose. I think I could use switch statements for this. Alternatively I could throw some else statements in there but functionally that wouldn't change much compared to the if statements.
